                <h1><a name="1"></a>Idea #1: Creating an Inclusive Classroom Community</h1>
                <p><em>&ldquo;[P]romoting community, conceived of in critical ways, is an important aspect of education for social justice and that it is essential to developing the systems, structures, and networks necessary for sustaining social justice efforts beyond the classroom walls.&rdquo;</em><sup>3</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Learning Intention</strong></p>
                <p>Creating an active and encouraging classroom community helps students think more critically about their unique perspectives while also considering the valuable perspectives their peers bring. Successful social change cannot be done in isolation; a strong community is essential. &ldquo;[W]hat is most important is for the instructor to conscientiously create community through facilitation of activities that require students to both critically reflect upon their experiences and simultaneously support each other.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                <p>Provide opportunities within the classroom for students to have exposure and practice participating in environments conducive to social justice learning. &ldquo;Community-building should be introduced intentionally, and then honored and maintained with care and attention through ongoing debriefs and closures for course or workshop segments.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Suggestions</strong></p>
                <ul style="list-style: initial; margin-left: 0.2in;">
                  <li><strong>Develop principles: </strong>Consider developing &ldquo;principles of practice&rdquo; with the class that can be enacted, including things like humor and joy, which can protect the environment for everyone in the conversation.<sup>5</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Create guidelines: </strong>Creating class guidelines with students at the start of the term can be an effective method to begin the formation of community and collective course goals. Encourage students to challenge their comfort zones and be open to new ideas; however, ensure that it is done it a way that does not seem punitive and allows space for people living out the issues being discussed.<sup>2,5</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Create an inclusive environment: </strong>Structure your classroom to model a non-competitive environment. Students can feel intimidated when large discussions feel more competitive than collaborative, which can make it difficult to create an inviting community in the classroom. Encourage students to be conscious of who contributes and aim to keep it balanced, by planning different styles of activities that appeal to a variety of learning styles and comforts.<sup>4</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Allow informal interactions: </strong>More informal interactions can also help students create a trusting community.<sup>1</sup> Incorporate these more personal methods of interaction in the classroom, by establishing smaller breakout groups for discussions, providing optional opportunities to share personal experiences, or incorporating arts-based activities that require active student participation and engagement.<sup>3</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Let students share: </strong>Allow students to voice their personal reflections on course content. &ldquo;[T]he sharing of experiences with peers increase[s] unity within the learning space.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup> Listening to the other voices in the classroom provides the chance for students to connect with real issues of social justice, deepening learning by sharing experiences.</li>
                  <li><strong>Incorporate collaborative exercises:</strong> This can help students feel more connected to their classmates. Provide opportunities such as collective brainstorming, team discussions, and other group activities to give students the chance to interact together.<sup>4</sup></li>
                </ul>

                <h1><a name="2"></a>Idea #2: Framing Spaces for Courageous Conversations</h1>
                <p><em>&ldquo;We have to be brave because along the way we are going to be &lsquo;vulnerable and exposed&rsquo;; we are going to encounter images that are &lsquo;alienating and shocking&rsquo;. We are going to be very unsafe.&rdquo;</em><sup>3</sup></p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Learning Intention</strong></p>
                <p>&ldquo;Learning does not take place when our firmly held beliefs are never challenged. It is the hallmark of a robust education that students graduate having been exposed to new ideas, differing perspectives, and challenging ways of thinking. This process can and should be difficult, messy, and certainly uncomfortable. In academic terms, it is when we are at the edge of discomfort that learning truly happens.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                <p>Brave spaces are those classroom environments &ldquo;in which [students] felt courageous enough to risk, explore, experiment, assert, learn, and change, knowing that they would be supported in those necessarily destabilizing and unpredictable processes.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Characteristics</strong></p>
                <p>These five &ldquo;common rules&rdquo; can help establish brave spaces in your classroom.<sup>1</sup></p>
                <ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-left: 0.2in; list-style: decimal;">
                  <li>Controversy with Civility: Rather than simply &ldquo;agreeing to disagree&rdquo; welcome conflicting viewpoints and rigorous challenge and seek to understand divergent viewpoints while being respectful of strong emotions and differences in experience.</li>
                  <li>Own Your Intentions and Impact: Instead of expecting peers to &ldquo;avoid taking things personally,&rdquo; acknowledge the emotional impact of what you share and take some responsibility for how your comments affect others.</li>
                  <li>Challenge by Reflective Choice: While it is permissible to engage silently, it is important that participants are encouraged to reflect on the factors that affect their decision to participate or remain quiet. Point out which groups are contributing and which are not and ask students to consider why certain people are engaging actively and others are not.</li>
                  <li>Regardful Respect: Demonstrating respect may look different to different people; encourage students to talk openly about ways to show respect (and things to avoid that show disrespect) and highlight challenges or differences in approach to negotiate agreements in class.</li>
                  <li>Avoid Attacks: Discuss, and help students brainstorm specific arguments that demonstrate how to challenge ideas, beliefs or statements without attacking, insulting, or disrespecting people.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
                <ul style="list-style: initial; margin-left: 0.2in;">
                  <li><strong>Address issues of power and marginalization: </strong>Conversations and classroom activities are experienced differently by students in agent (dominant) groups versus those in target (marginalized) groups. Agent group students may feel persecuted or blamed, while target groups students are likely to feel frustrated by painful reminders of their oppression.<sup>1</sup> Be sure to avoid expecting target group students to take on the role of educator, and support agent group students in leaning in to their discomfort.<sup>1,8</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Principles rather than guidelines: </strong>&ldquo;Class rules, or community agreements...even if they&rsquo;re done in the best way, they can feel punitive for students&rdquo; like a list of what they aren&rsquo;t allowed to do. Instead, think and talk about them as &ldquo;principles of practice&rdquo; that can be enacted, including things like humor and joy, which can protect the environment for everyone in the conversation.<sup>7</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Brainstorm principles collaboratively:</strong> Setting expectations yourself could &ldquo;convey a message steeped in privilege and set up the belief that student voices don&rsquo;t matter in your classroom.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup> Instead, invite students to participate in a conversation about how to engage bravely with one another. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/581e9e06ff7c509a5ca2fe32/t/58f25fa937c58130853337df/1492279209799/04+AWARE-LA+Brave+Space+Guidelines+and+History.pdf"><span style="color: #1155cc;">Common Guidelines for a Brave Space</span></a> has several examples and issues to consider in creating a brave space in your classroom.<sup>2</sup></li>

                <h1><a name="3"></a>Idea #3: ORID: The Art of Focused Conversation</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Learning Intention: &ldquo;</strong>Once a society loses this capacity [for dialogue] all that is left is a cacophony of voices battling it out to see who wins and who loses.&rdquo; --Peter M. Senge <sup>6</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                <p>This discussion facilitation technique leads participants in a conversation that flows from surface to depth by posing questions in a progressive series of depths to build consensus or action plans on challenging issues.<sup>6</sup> The acronym, ORID, stands for the four levels of questions: objective, reflective, interpretive, and decisional.<sup>1</sup></p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Instructions</strong><sup>3,5,6</sup></p>
                <ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-left: 0.2in; list-style: decimal;">
                  <li><strong>Objective: Get the facts by engaging the five senses.</strong></li>

                <p>Ask questions that will invite inclusive participation, focus attention, and help students gather the basic data, such as, &ldquo;Who was present?&rdquo; &ldquo;What did you see/hear?&rdquo; &ldquo;What did you notice?&rdquo;<sup>5</sup></p>

                  <li><strong>Reflective: Share immediate emotional responses or experiences.</strong></li>

                <p>Ask questions that allow students to acknowledge their emotions, memories and associations, such as, &ldquo;How did you feel about___?&rdquo; &ldquo;What are you confused about?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is most exciting/difficult/boring/easy?&rdquo;</p>

                  <li><strong>Interpretive: Identify meaning, values, purpose or implications attached to the topic.</strong></li>

                <p>Ask questions that raise awareness of logical connections and available options, such as &ldquo;What difference will it make?&rdquo; &ldquo;How has this been beneficial/detrimental?&rdquo; &ldquo;What insights are beginning to emerge?&rdquo; &ldquo;What values are we holding?&rdquo;</p>

                  <li><strong>Decisional: Decide on a resolution, action, direction or steps.</strong></li>
                
                <p>Ask questions that draw out deeper meaning and may lead to relevant future action, such as, &ldquo;What would it look like to&hellip;?&rdquo; &ldquo;What are we committed to?&rdquo; &ldquo;What will you do differently?&rdquo;</p>
                </ol>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Considerations</strong><sup>4,6</sup></p>
                <ul style="list-style: initial; margin-left: 0.2in">
                  <li><strong>Plan open-ended questions: </strong>Be sure the questions require elaboration from students, not a simple yes or no response, and arrange them in a useful order. There is a fantastic <a href="https://organizationalexcellence.virginia.edu/sites/organizationalexcellence.virginia.edu/files/PC_ORID_Questions_List.pdf"><span style="color: #1155cc;">list of sample questions</span></a> available from University of Virginia.</li>
                  <li><strong>No &ldquo;right&rdquo; answers: </strong>Instead of imparting ideas or &ldquo;teaching,&rdquo; trust the wisdom of the group to let ideas emerge organically and build collective understanding.</li>
                  <li><strong>Be specific: </strong>To get the best results ask for specific examples or illustrations from students to clarify their contributions.</li>
                  <li><strong>Set aside enough time: </strong>Unlike reaching a simple conclusion, confronting a challenging issue takes time to reach deep engagement and insight.</li>

                <h1><a name="4"></a>Idea #4: Leaning into Constructive Discussions</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Learning Intention: &ldquo;</strong>The struggle has always been inner, and is played out in outer terrains. Awareness of our situation must come before inner changes, which in turn come before changes in society. Nothing happens in the "real" world unless it first happens in the images in our heads.&rdquo; --Gloria Anzald&uacute;a<sup>1</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                <p>This discussion facilitation technique is for educators who teach social justice education and &ldquo;struggle with student resistance to new and challenging critical frameworks.&rdquo;<sup>2,4</sup> It suggests teachers address students directly and offer guidelines for constructive engagement.<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Instructions</strong><sup>2,3,5</sup></p>
                <p>The ideas proffered by this approach to &ldquo;maximize learning of social justice content&rdquo; suggest that students:</p>
                <ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-left: 0.2in; list-style: decimal;">
                  <li>Strive for intellectual humility.</li>
                  <li>Recognize the difference between opinions and informed knowledge.</li>
                  <li>Let go of personal anecdotal evidence and look at broader societal patterns.</li>
                  <li>Notice one&rsquo;s own defensive reactions and attempt to use these reactions as entry points for gaining deeper self-knowledge.</li>
                  <li>Recognize how one&rsquo;s own social positionality (such as race, class, gender, sexuality, ability-status) informs perspectives and reactions to the instructor and work studied in the course.</li>
                  <li>Differentiate between safety and comfort. Accept discomfort as necessary for social justice growth.</li>
                  <li>Identify where your learning edge is and push it.</li>
                </ol>

                      <li>While constructive conversations may be valuable, most often grades will be determined by demonstration of comprehension.</li>
                      <li>Not everyone will have the same path to comprehension, yet effort is not the same as understanding. Grades are not determined by how &ldquo;hard&rdquo; a student works but on the outcome of that work.</li>

                <h1><a name="5"></a>Idea #5: Modeling Comfort with Discomfort</h1>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Learning Intention:</strong> &ldquo;Teaching and learning [are] <em>emotional </em>processes and activities as well as <em>cognitive </em>ones&rdquo; --Audrey Bryan<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Overview: </strong>As the saying goes, actions speak louder than words and students will be more likely to learn by what you do than by what you say.<sup>4</sup> Modeling social awareness and respect for differences is important, but it may be even more important to show students what it looks like to engage with discomfort instead of reverting to defense mechanisms or ignoring. &ldquo;There is no way to teach social justice without engaging fearlessly with your students, willing yourself to allow for the cracks to show in your teaching armor as you demonstrate, firsthand and right in front of them, the necessity of being comfortable with discomfort and daring to fail.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup></p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Suggestions</strong></p>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 0.2in;">
                  <li><strong>Do Important Work Even When It&rsquo;s Scary: </strong>Whether it is co-creating course expectations or admitting your own shortcomings or blind-spots, let students learn by your example. &ldquo;It never fails to empower the students to take ownership of their learning and become more willing to engage in the &lsquo;hard-a** stuff&rsquo;.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Dialogue, Don&rsquo;t Monologue:</strong> Discuss course goals and content <em>with</em> students, instead of dictating to them, and truly listen to their experiences and interests.<sup>3</sup> Invite students to participate with you in negotiating ground rules and expectations as well.<sup>4</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Make Confessions: </strong>Show students your own journey and reveal struggles you&rsquo;ve had encountered, both in the past and in the present. Whether those encounters are about racism you&rsquo;ve faced or racism you&rsquo;ve embodied, let students see your example.<sup>1,4</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Be a Humble Learner</strong>: Learn to approach each class and discussion with fresh eyes, &ldquo;be [like a] baby, beginning with nothing, and learn it new again.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup> Be willing to listen to and learn from your students, and when you come to a new realization, humbly acknowledge that learning with your students.<sup>3,4</sup></li>

                <h1><a name="6"></a>Idea #6: Discovering Hidden Biases</h1>
                <p><em>&ldquo;Only when we become aware of our biases and assumptions can we take active, conscious steps to overcome them and minimize their impact.&rdquo;</em><sup>1</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Learning Intention</strong></p>
                <p>Recognizing perspective is an important step in discussing social justice topics. &ldquo;[L]ooking at your own biases and privileges helps you interact more effectively with people in the school community because you develop a better understanding of your perspectives, their perspectives, and how any differences between them might affect your interactions.&rdquo;<sup>4</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                <p>Measuring our implicit associations of social groups can reveal our subconscious biases and stereotypes. Biases influence what and how we teach and learn. Discussing their impact in the classroom setting facilitates a discussion about our perspectives on particular social justice topics. The &ldquo;IAT can be an effective tool for educators to increase awareness of bias regardless of participants&rsquo; positive and/or negative responses to the experience.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 0.2in">
                  <li><strong>Assign Implicit Association Test.</strong> Encourage students to take the <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit"><span style="color: #1155cc;">Implicit Association Test</span></a> from Project Implicit. There are free association tests on a variety of topics, including gender, race, age, and sexual orientation. Specify which test students should take if there is one particularly relevant to the course. If discussing biases in general, students could choose which topic they would like to take.</li>
                  <li><strong>Develop reflection questions.</strong> Set up the discussion as a learning opportunity to raise consciousness about implicit bias. Questions might focus on reactions to the test results, how implicit biases impact our conscious behaviors, what it means when our results say something contrary to what we believe, and how we can combat biases.<sup>3</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Discuss results. </strong>Facilitate a respectful discussion based on the students responses to the reflection questions. Make connections between the implications of biases and the teaching and learning of the course.<sup>3</sup></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 0.2in">
                  <li><strong>Test yourself, too.</strong> By examining biases and modeling self-awareness, instructors &ldquo;are likely to garner more trust and respect from students.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Understand some students may not want to take the test.</strong> As an alternative assignment, create questions that ask students to reflect on the effects of biases and prejudice in the classroom.</li>
                  <li><strong>Create a positive tone.</strong> &ldquo;Research suggests that expanding our knowledge of and contact with different groups, monitoring our thoughts and biases, engaging in perspective-taking, and building empathy are ways to mitigate unconscious bias.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Racism affects all disciplines, and addressing it in class can provide &ldquo;a much-needed framework for helping students understand present realities and their historical context, and identify ways to address such issues on campus and in the larger society.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                <p>&ldquo;Microaggressions are acts of disregard or subtle insults stemming from often-unconscious attitudes of white superiority.&rdquo;<sup>1</sup> Identifying racial microaggressions can increase student awareness of how to address the conscious and unconscious harmful behaviors and comments they may encounter.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
                <ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-left: 0.2in; list-style: decimal;">
                  <li><strong>Define</strong>: The term &lsquo;microaggression&rsquo; can be better understood by breaking it down into more specific categories. <em>Microinsults</em> are often unconscious, inconsiderate, degrading comments or actions. <em>Microassaults</em> are generally conscious attacks commited with harmful intents. <em>Microinvalidations</em> are usually unconscious behaviors or remarks that refute the realities experienced by a person of color.<sup>2</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Share</strong>: Ask students to reflect on where they have experienced, witnessed, or committed microaggressions. Have students share examples of racial microaggressions that fall under the three types listed before: microinsults, microassaults, and microinvalidations.<sup>4</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Record</strong>: Write down the examples students provide under each of the categories.</li>
                  <li><strong>Brainstorm</strong>: Collaboratively come up with methods on how students can interrupt or challenge each microaggression. Possible solutions may include requesting elaboration, reframing the situation, re-directing the topic, or revisiting a microaggression that may have occurred in the past.<sup>3</sup></li>
                </ol>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 0.2in;">
                  <li>Cater the exercise to microaggressions students have encountered in a specific familiar setting, such as in university, their classes, or extracurriculars, to reinforce the relevance of this topic.<sup>4</sup></li>
                  <li>How you say something can be as important as what you say. During the Brainstorming phase, encourage students to consider the techniques they would use to address microaggressions. This might include body language, tone of voice, timing, and an appropriate use of humor.<sup>3</sup></li>
                  <li>Microaggressions are certainly not limited to racial microaggressions; expand the conversation.</li>

                <h1><a name="8"></a>Idea #8: Service Learning for Social Justice</h1>
                <p><em>&ldquo;Combining community service activities with the study of social issues can give students additional ideas for how they can contribute to meaningful societal change and can strengthen service-learning activities by helping students learn the skills, knowledge and attitudes they need to participate in improving the larger society.&rdquo;</em><sup>5</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Learning Intention</strong></p>
                <p>Service learning can help students discover ways in which they can apply their classroom knowledge of social justice to their participation in community issues. &ldquo;By engaging in purposefully designed community work, we can involve students in conversations about social justice and their roles as community members.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                <p>Partnering with relevant community organizations for &ldquo;[Justice-Based Service Learning] provides students with the opportunity to examine their privilege and to put it to work to create social change. [Justice-Based Service Learning] incorporates reflection at all stages of an experience, especially through activities and assignments that promote critical thinking about social issues and one&rsquo;s own place in the world, and in the creation and maintenance of those social problems.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 0.2in">
                  <li><strong>Understand local issues.</strong> Service learning is most effective if students have a grasp on the context of the issues that impact the community. This could involve researching the history of the partnering organization, or inviting guest speakers to answer student questions on more complex matters.<sup>2</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Promote reflection.</strong> &ldquo;Providing students with an opportunity to reflect on their service experiences both individually and in groups can support students making connections between &ldquo;out-of-the-classroom knowledge&rdquo; ...and academic learning.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Encourage lasting service.</strong> Community organizations benefit from committed students, and long-term opportunities provides students with more opportunities to learn.<sup>2</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Make opportunities accessible.</strong> An obstacle to service learning can be the time and resources required for students to fit community work into their schedules. Promote activities that have credit or scholarship benefits to make learning opportunities more viable for students.<sup>2</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Plan a mutually beneficial project</strong>. Make sure the service learning benefits the partnering organizations as much as student learning. Reflect on the EPA&rsquo;s Levels of Community Engagement when planning how best to partner with an organization.<sup>3</sup> Consider partnering to work specifically on the organization&rsquo;s side projects. This allows students to see the completion of a project while helping organizations accomplish projects where they would otherwise have limited resources.<sup>4</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Make connections. </strong>Select learning opportunities that &ldquo;address the interplay of students&rsquo; fields of study with the issues of inequality that impact their own communities&rdquo; to form links between civic engagement and students&rsquo; career path.<sup>1</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Establish rich discussions.</strong> Have students share their experiences and encourage them to generate thought on the social justice issues and insights they have gained while participating in service learning activities.<sup>2</sup></li>
                </ul>

                <h1><a name="9"></a>Idea #9: Conflicts and Intersections Across Movements</h1>
                <p><em>&ldquo;Think about conflicts happening in the world today. Conflict exists because each side believes they are justified, or entitled, to a certain kind of justice.&rdquo;</em><sup>1</sup></p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Learning Intention: </strong>Justice is often viewed differently by different communities or groups of people. This activity helps students explore various concepts of justice by letting them &ldquo;compare and contrast differences, overlaps, and intersections&rdquo; of what justice might look like from various perspectives.<sup>1</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Overview</strong><sup>1</sup></p>
                <p>Choose a conflict to use as a case study. You could use predetermined examples from the course topic/theme, such as a current local or global event, or use more simple examples that draw on students&rsquo; own lived experiences.Then have students imagine and discuss what justice looks like for each side and why it might look different for different people.

                  <li>What injustices are being identified?</li>
                  <li>Which groups are affected by the injustice?</li>
                  <li>Which groups are identified as causing the problem? (Note: this could, and should, be broad).</li>
                  <li>What did justice look like for each side? Was it conflicting, intersecting, or a little of both?</li>
                  <li>What possible solutions are offered or requested?</li>
                  <li>What possible solutions can you think of?</li>
                  <li>How does power (over policies, land, peoples, and money) work to influence who gets justice? Is it sometimes easier for the party with more power to attain justice for their side of the problem?</li>

                <p><em>&ldquo;Many individuals are drawn to higher education, including academic careers, because of academe&rsquo;s potential for change ...Unfortunately, many colleges and universities in the U.S. have practiced outright discrimination and exclusion throughout history&rdquo;</em><sup>1</sup></p>

                <p><strong>Learning Intention: </strong>Studying events in context not only makes them clearer, it provides important backdrops that help prevent oversimplification of complicated issues. This activity uses contrapuntal reading<sup>1</sup> to &ldquo;analyze historical texts and moments&rdquo; to understand the complexities of social justice.

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Overview</strong><sup>1</sup></p>
                <p>Identify the treaties or other practices of land theft used to settle the area you&rsquo;re currently teaching in. Have students discuss:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 0.2in; list-style: initial;">
                  <li>What was promised in the Treaty?</li>

                  <li>How does the Treaty view the relationship between the state and Indigenous people?</li>
                  <li>Are there accounts of what Indigenous people understood the Treaty to mean?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Then, using contrapuntal reading,<sup>1</sup> have students examine any federal laws that passed at the same time as many treaties in the United States and discuss the following questions:</p>

                  <li>What is different about the way the federal act/law views the relationship between the federal government and Indigenous people?</li>
                  <li>How can the ideas, promises, and concepts used in the Treaty take place under the regulations and limits of federal laws? What is made possible, and what is made impossible?</li>
                  <li>What can looking at these simultaneous events in the same moment teach us about what justice was sought, what might have ended up being recuperated by the state, or about how victory and backlash can take place together?</li>

                  <li>Who is this music being created for?</li>

                  <li>What is special about it?</li>
                  <li>How do the songs in the playlist envision different ideas of justice?</li>
                  <li>What specific lyrics best describe justice movements or actions?</li>
                  <li>Are there places where lyrics or verses contradict others within the same song? What does that mean to you?</li>
                  <li>Do the songs in your list represent competing forms of justice, or could they take place together?</li>
                  <li>Mass media as an industry can exploit and harm artists. Are there situations where these artists seem to have been co-opted by popular culture? Explain.</li>

                <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 0.2in;">
                  <li>Have students listen to a playlist, album, or song that you have chosen/curated and do a personal response assignment to it. They could use the same reflection questions as above, or have them suggest another song/album that could either speak back to the artist&rsquo;s version of justice, or compliment the version of justice it is expressing.</li>
                  <li>Have students share their playlists, or a single song, with the class and discuss the music together. What parallels exist in the music chosen by various members of the class? Can you identify intersectionalities or competing perspectives on justice?</li>

                <h1><a name="13"></a>Idea #13: The Power (or Limit) of the Media to Disrupt Injustice</h1>
                <p><em>&ldquo;In this age of social media, both groups and individuals use YouTube [and other social media] to share their ideas about justice.&rdquo;</em><sup>1</sup></p>
                <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Learning Intention: &ldquo;</strong>What are the two most recent &ldquo;viral moments&rdquo; you can think of that occurred on social media? Were these about justice? If so, what agendas of justice did they promote? Can you think of any they obscured? This activity sends you on a mini-tour of select videos and &ldquo;media moments&rdquo; that directly confront, and work to generate different ways of thinking about, injustice.&rdquo;<sup>1,2,3</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Overview</strong><sup>1</sup></p>
                <p>Pick or have students choose a media moment and watch the video or other associated online content. (If you need more context, read about the situation as well). The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toward-What-Justice-Describing-Education/dp/1138205710"><span style="color: #1155cc;">Toward What Justice?</span></a> includes a list of sample texts/videos and further questions for reflection. Then discuss:</p>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 0.2in;">
                  <li>What form(s) of justice were the characters in this video asking for? Or, what injustice happened in this media moment to provoke a major outcry?</li>
                  <li>What is the overall message?</li>
                  <li>Who is this message aimed at?</li>
                  <li>What strategy or strategies are being used to send the message (humor, shaming, criticism, etc.)&hellip; do you think this strategy is helpful? Why or why not?</li>
                  <li>Describe what the media is asking individuals to do.</li>
                  <li>Is this content asking for change on an individual level, on the systemic level, or both?</li>
                  <li>Discuss what systemic change needs to happen in order for this to not have to exist.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Options and Reflection</strong><sup>1</sup></p>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 0.2in;">
                  <li>This media may be crafted in direct opposition to other current media trends. Describe what those are and why they might be problematic. How does mass media work to uphold or retrench injustices?</li>
                  <li>Find a text that is associated with or connected to this content. Discuss whether it offers critique or support to the content.</li>
                  <li>Research and collect the mentions of a marginalized group (queer, black, etc.) in the media for the past week. Analyze these stories to find occurrences of violence, oppressions, resistance, and subversion. Using headlines, cut out pictures and any other creative content, make a 5&ndash;10 page zine that contours and describes the creative subversions of the marginalized group in the media.</li>

                <h1><a name="15"></a>Idea #15: Exploring Identity Development</h1>
                <p><strong>Learning Intention: &ldquo;</strong>The point of [these activities] was to bring our many identities, our perceptions of our identities, and the way others perceive our identities to the forefront of critical discussion. Not only was this a great way to get to know each other better, but it was a great way to practice vulnerability and empathy. It was a great way to let ourselves &ldquo;be seen,&rdquo; meanwhile taking a close and non-judgmental look at ourselves and our peers. The diversity in the room was humbling, diversity that I was unable to see just hours before.&rdquo;<sup>2</sup></p>
                <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                <p>&ldquo;Social identities such as race, gender, sexuality, and class are constructed and reinforced by socio-cultural interactions and context. [These activities] prompt students to reflectively engage with aspects of their own identities and identities they learned about but don&rsquo;t share.&rdquo;<sup>6</sup></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Options</strong></p>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left: 0.2in;">
                  <li><strong>Identity Development Timeline</strong>: Have students choose one or more elements of social identity and create a timeline highlighting key events or messages that help shape their sense of self. Elements might include gender, race/ethnicity, age, socio-economic class, spirituality, sexual orientation, physical ability, or national origin. Students should reflect on the messages they heard about that identity, where those messages came from, when they happened, and what concrete behaviors those messages encouraged or discouraged. The <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/inclusive-teaching/2017/08/24/mapping-social-identity-timeline-activity/"><span style="color: #1155cc;">Mapping Social Identity</span></a><sup>6</sup> exercise has some additional guidelines, or you could use the<a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/919517/files/28741815/download"><span style="color: #1155cc;"> Identity Timeline Worksheet</span></a><sup>5</sup> to guide students in mapping their identity development.</li>
                  <li><strong>Social Identity Wheel:</strong> Help students recognize the concept of intersectionality by completing an identity wheel that represents their various identities. Encourage them to reflect on which parts of their identity give them privilege and which make them a target, as well as which parts are more essential and which are less important.<sup>1,2</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Pronoun Introductions</strong>: &ldquo;Because gender is so deeply woven into our upbringing and socialization, it is one of the most internally difficult aspects of our worldview to challenge. And because gendering (the social assignment or designation of a person&rsquo;s gender, usually on the basis of perceived sex) is often a key aspect of our interactions&mdash;from the use of pronouns to the social scripts we&rsquo;ve internalized&mdash;the way we think about gender is constantly on display through our words and actions.&rdquo;<sup>3</sup> One suggestion for avoiding misgendering people in class is to ask them to include their preferred pronouns when they introduce themselves. This practice can be controversial, though, as it may force students to come out about their gender on the first day of class or it could be uncomfortable for students who are exploring their gender identity.<sup>7</sup></li>
                  <li><strong>Genderbread</strong>: This model was developed to introduce students to, and help them distinguish between, concepts of gender identity, gender expression, biological sex, and romantic and sexual attraction. You can use the <a href="http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Genderbread-Person-3.3-HI-RES.pdf"><span style="color: #1155cc;">handout</span></a> as part of a lecture or pair it with the <a href="http://u1kwao9i7u9xyle2hibw4g6h.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Breaking-through-the-Binary-by-Sam-Killermann.pdf"><span style="color: #1155cc;">article</span></a> or the book <a href="http://www.guidetogender.com/?utm_source=ipm&amp;utm_campaign=preorder&amp;utm_medium=intext"><span style="color: #1155cc;">A Guide to Gender: The Social Justice Advocate&rsquo;s Handbook</span></a>.<sup>4</sup> You could even make it part of a reflective assignment or discussion activity. Students could chart their own continua, or use examples from films or novels to explore the continua.</li>
