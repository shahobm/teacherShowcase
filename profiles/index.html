            <h3>All the People Who Do This Work</h3>

            <p>
              There are many professors who teach at WWU who are working to engage students in social justice, who are engaging in social justice work because they feel they must, and who are simply living the work so fully that it touches everything they do. Many of these individuals are tasked heavily to do this work upholding the university's requirements of teaching, scholarship, and service in the course of their professional lives and while mentoring and advising students as well as colleagues.
            </p>

            <p>
              We honor with warmth and gratitude all those who contributed to this project, those who could not catch their breath long enough to do so, and those who do not feel safe enough to be this public about what they do. We would also like to thank others in the Western community doing this challenging and important work.

              Josh Cerretti teaches for social justice in honor of the insurgent movements of young people that brought the critical study of gender, race, and sexuality into the academy. Dr. Cerretti has always strived to be an activist-scholar, linking his organizing against state violence to his research on it, connecting his commitment to a curriculum that decenters whiteness to solidarity work with local communities of color, and turning his gratitude for public education into a staunch defense of public education for all. He brings the conflicts between historical injustices and the movements that confronted them to life in the classroom in order to give his students a usable past on which to build the future they seek to bring into being.

              Brett Coleman challenges students in human services work where his scholarly interests in race, the non-profit industrial complex, and community-based interventions meet the classroom. He focuses on identifying people on the margins of society and centers their voices. He provides real life examples of social justice work through a focus on community organizing and in sharing his own experiences. Through challenging articles that reframe the human services sector, Dr. Coleman brings to light ideas that often do not get attention in other approaches to social work. Employing various strategies, Dr. Coleman:

              <ul>
                <li>Encourages students to share perspectives, offering challenges but not answers</li>
                <li>Offers various world views to address issues</li>
                <li>Shares his experience with community organizing, providing context and complexity</li>
                <li>Tasks students with difficult readings, methods for processing them, and the challenge of presenting them to the class</li>
                <li>Empowers students to select relevant essay topics tied to frameworks, question their own motivations for wanting to help people, and examine the power dynamics that exist in any situation</li>
              </ul>

            </p>
            <p>
              This course is built around the Systemic Racism Curriculum Project (SRCP), a participatory action research project meant to engage people in understanding and confronting racism as a systemic process. Through the lens of racism as the chief form of inequity built into the fabric of U.S. society, we will also examine other forms of inequity that intersect with racism through the policies and institutions that shape our society and culture. Currently, students are researching how white people develop an understanding of systemic racism, and developing curriculum based on the findings.

            </p>
            <p>
              This class is based on a Participatory Action Research (PAR) model. PAR is based on the assumption that members of a community (that’s us) are quite knowledgeable about their problems and the solutions to those problems. Combining that community knowledge with “academic” or “expert” knowledge (e.g., theory and methodology) can empower the community to control its own destiny, particularly by amplifying the voices of its most disempowered community members. Currently, students are doing a research project meant to interrogate how the university responds to sexual assault.

              Dr. Kerman joined the Art and Art History Department full time in 2015, as the only faculty in the department specializing in African art history and visual culture. Although WWU students come from backgrounds with varying degrees of relationship to Africa and its diaspora, Dr. Kerman always starts her courses with an assessment of how people of African descent and their art are perceived here (in Bellingham, WA, USA) and now (the current year).
            </p>

            <p>
              In writing the syllabi for courses on the art of Africa and its diaspora, she aims to raise awareness of the structural racism in Western academic traditions, including art history. Her classes are constructed around the sources of authoritative knowledge within the original context of the art works—whether that is oral history, or a creation myth, or an artist’s workshop, or descriptions of the works provided by the artists themselves. Since the beginnings of colonialism, American (and other non-African) students had to rely primarily upon research and writing done by European and American figures, from within academia and without. In particular, most of the accessible images of Africans and others of African descent were created and disseminated by Europeans and Americans.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the effort towards decolonizing African art history, class readings are written by scholars of African descent whenever possible and interviews with the artists are included whenever available, so that their voices are privileged over any others. In this way, Dr. Kerman seeks to shift the Eurocentric perspective embedded in art history as a discipline and in the teaching of African art and culture more specifically.

              In this course, required for the Education for Social Justice Minor, students employ historical and modern constructions of critical theory in education to explore the socio-political context of youth in U.S. schools, mechanisms of social and cultural reproduction, and forms of resistance and political movement building for educational and social change. Attention is given to epistemological perspectives that challenge traditional academic ways of knowing. The course balances critical analysis with an emphasis on keeping hope alive through action, at the level of the individual, institution, and in society. This course is organized around three broad overlapping themes that aim to build a critical social justice literacy, particularly about schools and educational practices:

              <br>
              Critical Race Theory (CRT) was originally conceptualized in legal scholarship as discourse to identify racism as endemic to daily life in the United States. Since its inception it has expanded into the social sciences, humanities, and education as a critique of the functions of race and racism in society. Utilizing an interdisciplinary approach, CRT centers the stories and experiences of People of Color as critical to any discussion of race. Although highly contested due to its contextual and methodological approaches, CRT scholars have attempted to create a space to engage in discourse and praxis to challenge "color-evasive/post-race" rhetoric and policy.

            <p>
              This course explores Critical Race Theory as an epistemological, methodological, and pedagogical "entry point" to the study of race and racism in P-20 education. Incorporating legal, historical, policy analysis and sociological approaches, this class attempts to deepen a critical race analysis in the examination of educational concerns. Students will also analyze the strengths and limitations of CRT as an explanatory framework, while placing CRT in the realm of education for social justice.

              Jane Wong is an Assistant Professor of Creative Writing. She seeks to alter the Western literary canon, which perpetuates a majority white, male literary lineage. The vast majority of her course texts are by writers of color and engage frameworks based on social justice and equity. She fosters strong poetic communities based on encouragement, reflection, social justice, and real-world stakes and focuses on writing as a safe means toward visibility and inclusion.

            Cameron Wuhr implements inquiry based learning, applied learning, and experiential learning techniques to engage students in critical conversations about social justice issues in education. His approach challenges students to discover personal and social responsibility to advocate for social justice. He asks students to wrestle with challenging and locally relevant topics like cultural competence, intersectionalities, and microaggressions, as well as more underlying topics like white fragility and DACA.

              "Rather than the goal of political unity with commonly shared objectives, an ethic of incommensurability acknowledges that we can collaborate for a time together even while anticipating that our pathways toward enacting liberation will diverge. Incommensurability means that we cannot judge each other's justice projects by the same standard, but we can come to understand the gap between our viewpoints, and thus work together in contingent collaboration."
